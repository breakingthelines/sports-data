/**
 * Bridge: ingestion loop → match-concluded publisher.
 *
 * The {@link ApiFootballIngestionLoop} owns the polling cadence and the
 * cache/quota machinery. The {@link MatchConcludedPublisher} owns the
 * Redis Streams XADD and the emit-once gate. This module is the thin
 * adapter between them:
 *
 *   1. Decode an API-Football `/fixtures?id=<id>` response envelope.
 *   2. Resolve provider teams/players/competitions through identity where
 *      possible, preserving unresolved provider refs when identity misses.
 *      Seasons are never resolved here: game-service binds them
 *      (season_id_bindings, forward-only) and the connector must not
 *      pre-resolve them.
 *   3. Resolve the provider fixture id → BTL canonical `game_id` via
 *      `game-service.LookupGameByFixture` (the crosswalk lives in
 *      `provider_game_mappings`, populated by `IngestGames`).
 *   4. Hand the resulting envelope to `publisher.observe(fixture)`.
 *
 * Why game-service and not identity-server: identity-server runs on a
 * read-only SQLite snapshot (release-asset distribution) and does not
 * carry fixture-level crosswalks; its `Resolve(GAME, ...)` calls will
 * always miss. The live crosswalk is on game-service. The
 * identity-client is used for provider participant/entity resolution, but
 * only the GAME read path resolves through game-service.
 *
 * The bridge NEVER throws — every failure path logs a structured event
 * and returns. Back-pressure on ingest would defeat the worker's call
 * budget guarantees, and the publisher already records non-terminal /
 * already-emitted observations as benign outcomes.
 *
 * Scope intentionally narrow:
 *   - No fixture polling here (that's the loop's `start()` path).
 *   - No status correction handling (publisher's emit-once gate stays
 *     authoritative; the consumer on game-service owns rescore).
 *   - No new transport layers (the game-service client is injected;
 *     see `clients/game-service.ts` for the fetch-based default).
